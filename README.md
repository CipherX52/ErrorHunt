# ErrorHunt

Working app hosted on Heroku, [here](https://library-app5213.herokuapp.com/).

Using EJS to render pages, NodeJS and Express for building the app and MongoDB for data storage and management.
App is connected to a MongoDB Atlas Cluster, which I'll probably remove after a while. For the time being, I believe all the required functionalities are working as intended.
