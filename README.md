# ErrorHunt

Basic library app to which you can add books and authors with some details.

Working app hosted on Heroku, [here](https://library-app5213.herokuapp.com/).

Using EJS to render pages, NodeJS and Express for building the app and MongoDB for data storage.

App is connected to a MongoDB Atlas Cluster, which I'll probably remove after a while. For the time being, I believe all the required functionalities are working as intended.
